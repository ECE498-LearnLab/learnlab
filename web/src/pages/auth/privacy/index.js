      <p>Last updated: March 2021</p>
      <p>
        LearnLab is committed to continually improving how we communicate our privacy practices.
        This “Privacy Statement” explains how we handle personal information of Student Users (as
        defined below) of Instructor Users (as defined below) who are under the age of 18 years. It
        also reflects LearnLab’s compliance with the applicable requirements of the Children’s
        Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the
        Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), the California Student Online Personal
        Information Protection Act (“SOPIPA”), the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”),
        and other applicable laws.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        For purposes of this Privacy Statement, personal information (or “personal data”) means
        information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain Student Users may be created under contracts between LearnLab and the Instructor
        User that include a data processing addendum or other specific provisions governing Student
        User personal information. To the extent there is any conflict between such contracts and
        the terms of this Privacy Statement, the terms of our contracts with Instructor Users will
        control.{' '}
      </p>
      <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        Instructor User means teachers, principals, and other educators and school personnel
        authorized to use its Account for educational purposes, including to facilitate meetings
        with Student Users. Student User means a student that the Instructor User permits to use the
        Services.
      </p>
      <h2 id="instructor-users">Instructor Users</h2>
      <p>
        Instructor Users can use LearnLab’s learning management system and video communications
        platform. LearnLab securely and confidentially provides learning information to Student
        Users to ensure that the Instructor User can supervise and control its Student Users’
        learning experiences.
      </p>
      <h2 id="student-users">Student Users</h2>
      <p>
        Student Users are not permitted to create Student Users but may be provisioned with a
        Account by the Instructor User. Instructor Users are responsible for obtaining any parental
        consent necessary for use of the Services under their Student Users by Student Users,
        including children under the age 13.
      </p>
      <h2 id="parties-roles">Parties’ Roles</h2>
      <h3 id="instructor-user">Instructor User</h3>
      <p>
        For purposes of FERPA, each Instructor User is a “school official”. The Instructor User is
        the decision-maker that determines how personal information is processed in connection with
        LearnLab’s provisions of Services under a Account. The Instructor User decides if and why to
        host a LearnLab meeting, and what features to use.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        When a Student User uses LearnLab’s Services through an Instructor User, the processing of
        Student User personal information by the applicable Instructor User is determined and
        administered by the Instructor User under its privacy policies. If a parent or legal
        guardian of a Student User has questions about how and why Student User personal information
        is collected, the legal basis for processing, or access requests, the parent or legal
        guardian should refer to the Instructor User’s privacy policies and direct all inquiries to
        the Account Administrator or Instructor User.{' '}
      </p>
      <h3 id="learnlab">LearnLab</h3>
      <p>
        LearnLab provides a learning management system and video communications platform to
        Instructor Users on behalf of and at the direction of the Instructor User. For purposes of
        FERPA, LearnLab is considered a “school official” and may receive Student User personal
        information through its contractual agreements because LearnLab is performing a service that
        furthers a “legitimate educational interest” (i.e., the provision of educational services in
        a remote setting). LearnLab maintains Student User personal information on behalf of, and at
        the direction of, the Instructor User and does not use the Student User personal information
        for other purposes except as permitted by applicable law, including FERPA and applicable
        agreements with Instructor Users.
      </p>
      <p>
        LearnLab is responsible for following the directions of the Instructor User. For example, on
        an Instructor User’s instructions, LearnLab may provide reports containing personal
        information relating to the Account and its users (including Student Users) to that
        Instructor User. Please visit our LearnLab and FERPA Compliance webpage for additional
        information.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK should review our Privacy Statement
        for additional information regarding how LearnLab addresses European privacy rights.

      <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3 id="from-the-instructor-user">From the Instructor User</h3>
      <p>
        When creating a Account under the direction of an Instructor User, the Instructor User must
        provide certain information, such as:
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructor User’s first and last name; job title; password; school issued-email address; and
      </p>
      <h3 id="from-student-users">From Student Users</h3>
      <p>
        LearnLab may receive personal information contained in “Customer Content.” Customer Content
        is any data an Instructor User uploads to the LearnLab communication platform connected with
        use of the Service.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Instructor Users can display or upload information that may be seen by other
        users of that Account, share files with Student User accounts, view and obtain engagement
        data for Student users, or allow Student Users to communicate using in-video questions
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such Customer Content may include personal information that is part of an “educational
        record” as defined by FERPA.{' '}
      </p>
      <h3 id="automatically">Automatically</h3>
      <p>
        LearnLab collects certain personal information automatically through the use of a Account
        including:
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about the use of the LearnLab platform, including type and frequency of actions
        taken, number of logs in or meeting entries, date and time, duration, quantity, quality,
        network connectivity, other platform performance metrics, and feature usage information,
        including use of video and screen sharing; and Information about a user’s device, network,
        and internet connection, such as IP address(es), MAC address, other device ID, device type,
        operating system type and version, type of camera, microphone and speaker, and client
        version. Use of Personal Information LearnLab uses personal information collected from and
        about Student Users only as needed to deliver the functionality of the LearnLab platform,
        operate the business (including to enhance or improve the LearnLab Services), and as
        directed by Instructor Users. For Student Users, this means that:
      </p>
      <p>
        LearnLab never sells Student User personal information LearnLab does not use Student User
        personal information to deliver behavioral advertising. There are no third-party advertising
        or analytics cookies on LearnLab’s product pages. Regarding cookies, LearnLab publishes two
        types of webpages: product and marketing. A product webpage enables a Student User to click
        on a hyperlink and join a LearnLab meeting. LearnLab’s product webpages serve only
        third-party cookies that are necessary for technical support and to deliver the service.
        There are no advertising or analytics cookies on our product webpages.
      </p>
      <h2 id="sharing-personal-information">Sharing Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside
        of LearnLab unless one of the following circumstances applies:

        </li>
        <li>
          With or As Directed by Instructor Users
          <p>
            Instructor Users have access to personal information (including Student User
            information) connected with their Account(s). Instructor Users may also direct us to

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          To Provide Our Services
          <p>
            We provide personal information to third-party service providers to help us provide the
            Service. Such service providers are prohibited from using personal information for any
            reason other than to provide the contracted-for services, and in compliance with
            appropriate privacy and security obligations.

          <p>
            We may share personal information collected during a LearnLab meeting with other
            participants of the same meeting during the use of the Service. For example, video and
            audio recordings, chat messages and other content shared by a Student User during a
            meeting, which may contain personal information of Student Users, may be available to
            all other participants in that meeting, as well as to any Instructor Users who host or
            co-host that meeting and the Account Administrator.

          For Certain Corporate Transactions
          <p>

            reasons, LearnLab decides to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize its businesses.
            In such transactions, we may disclose or transfer personal information to actual
            purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. Student User personal
            information will remain subject to this Privacy Statement unless it is changed by a
            successor entity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For Legal Reasons We share personal information outside of LearnLab if we believe that
            access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

        of LearnLab, our users or the public as required or permitted by law, including to help
        prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone. For more information about data we
        disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please
        see our Guidelines for Government Requests.
      </p>
      <h3 id="third-parties">Third Parties</h3>
      <p>
        LearnLab does not share personal information with third parties other than as described
        herein, or as required by law, except at the direction and on behalf of an Instructor User
      </p>
      <h3 id="security">Security</h3>
      <p>
        Maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of students’ personal information
        is a top priority. We use appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to help
        protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Customer Content
        is encrypted in transit between any devices running a LearnLab client and at rest when in
        permanent storage in the LearnLab Cloud. We also have taken steps to minimize the risk that
        meetings that include Student Users are disrupted by uninvited participants. Examples
        include enabling meeting passcodes and virtual waiting rooms by default for Student Users
        and configuring default screen share settings to limit in-meeting content sharing. For
        guidance on how to secure virtual classrooms, please review “Best Practices for Securing
        Your Classroom” and “How to Keep Uninvited Guests Out of Your LearnLab Event.”
      </p>
      <h3 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        LearnLab retains Instructor Users’ and Student Users’ personal information for as long as
        necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of
        satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal
        claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.{' '}
      </p>
      <h3 id="access-and-deletion-of-information">Access and deletion of information</h3>
      <p>
        If a Student User or his or her parent would like to request to access, review, refuse
        further collection of or delete a Student User’s personal information, they must contact
        their Instructor User with his or her request. Because LearnLab is required to comply with
        contractual confidentiality obligations related to Student Users’ data, we are not able to
        respond to parental or student requests directly. Instructor Users may direct requests to
        access, delete or restrict further collection or use of a Student User’s personal
        information to learnlabcanada@gmail.com. LearnLab also deletes information associated with
        Student Users upon receiving a valid deletion request from an Instructor User. Instructor
        Users can delete their content
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructor Users may access or request deletion of their personal information in the same
        manner as set forth in our Privacy Statement.{' '}
      </p>
      <h3 id="notice-of-changes-to-this-statement">Notice of Changes to this Statement</h3>
      <p>
        If we make any material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will post the revised
        statement with the date of revision on this page and provide notice of this change on our
        website. We will duly inform Instructor Users of any material changes via our platform. We
